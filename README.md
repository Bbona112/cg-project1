3D Molecular Dynamics Simulation in a Red Blood Cell
This project simulates a molecular environment within a red blood cell (RBC) using 3D visualization. The simulation includes core molecular structures, nucleus particles, and particles orbiting around each core. The model visualizes molecular bonding and dynamic interactions among particles, providing an interactive experience with free camera roaming.

Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to model and visualize molecular dynamics inside an RBC, simulating complex particle interactions, bonding, and movement. Each core structure inside the RBC contains smaller particles representing nucleus-like entities. These particles dynamically interact with each other, forming visualized bonds based on proximity. Additionally, users can navigate the environment using free camera movement for a 3D exploration.

Features
Red Blood Cell Enclosure: Encloses core particles and dynamic structures inside an RBC.
Core Structures with Nucleus Particles: Core molecules with nucleus particles and dynamic interactions.
Bond Visualization: Bond formation among particles based on distance criteria.
Free Camera Movement: Interactive navigation to explore the simulation.
Getting Started
To run this project, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed and a compatible Python environment (Python 3.x).

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Basic understanding of molecular dynamics and 3D simulation visualization
Dependencies
Install the following dependencies before running the project:

VPython - Used for 3D visualization and simulation.
You can install VPython via pip:

pip install vpython
For additional information on VPython, refer to the official VPython documentation.

Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3d-molecular-simulation.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd 3d-molecular-simulation
Ensure dependencies are installed by following the instructions in the Dependencies section.

Running the Project
Once you have installed the dependencies and set up the project, you can run the simulation with the following command:

python main.py
This will open the VPython 3D viewer where you can interact with the simulation.

Usage
Controls
Movement: Use W, A, S, D keys to move forward, left, backward, and right, respectively.
Camera Rotation: Use the arrow keys to rotate the camera left, right, up, or down.
Move Up/Down: Use Q to move up and E to move down.
Simulation Features
Red Blood Cell: The RBC appears as a semi-transparent red sphere containing the core structures and particles.
Core and Nucleus: Each core has an attached nucleus, with particles randomly generated inside.
Particle Bonds: Particles dynamically form single, double, or triple bonds based on proximity.
Dynamic Constraints: Particles are constrained within the RBC, bouncing back when reaching the boundary.
