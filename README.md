# 3D Molecular Dynamics Simulation in a Red Blood Cell

This project simulates a molecular environment within a red blood cell (RBC) using 3D visualization. The simulation includes core molecular structures, nucleus particles, and particles orbiting around each core. The model visualizes molecular bonding and dynamic interactions among particles, providing an interactive experience with free camera roaming.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to model and visualize molecular dynamics inside an RBC, simulating complex particle interactions, bonding, and movement. Each core structure inside the RBC contains smaller particles representing nucleus-like entities. These particles dynamically interact with each other, forming visualized bonds based on proximity. Additionally, users can navigate the environment using free camera movement for a 3D exploration.

## Features

- **Red Blood Cell Enclosure**: Encloses core particles and dynamic structures inside an RBC.
- **Core Structures with Nucleus Particles**: Core molecules with nucleus particles and dynamic interactions.
- **Bond Visualization**: Bond formation among particles based on distance criteria.
- **Free Camera Movement**: Interactive navigation to explore the simulation.

## Getting Started

To run this project, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed and a compatible Python environment (Python 3.x).

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Basic understanding of molecular dynamics and 3D simulation visualization

---

## Dependencies

Install the following dependencies before running the project:

1. **VPython** - Used for 3D visualization and simulation. 

You can install VPython via pip:

```bash
pip install vpython
```

For additional information on VPython, refer to the [official VPython documentation](https://vpython.org).

---

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3d-molecular-simulation.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd 3d-molecular-simulation
    ```

3. Ensure dependencies are installed by following the instructions in the [Dependencies](#dependencies) section.

---

## Running the Project

Once you have installed the dependencies and set up the project, you can run the simulation with the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will open the VPython 3D viewer where you can interact with the simulation.

## Usage

### Controls

- **Movement**: Use `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys to move forward, left, backward, and right, respectively.
- **Camera Rotation**: Use the arrow keys to rotate the camera left, right, up, or down.
- **Move Up/Down**: Use `Q` to move up and `E` to move down.

### Simulation Features

1. **Red Blood Cell**: The RBC appears as a semi-transparent red sphere containing the core structures and particles.
2. **Core and Nucleus**: Each core has an attached nucleus, with particles randomly generated inside.
3. **Particle Bonds**: Particles dynamically form single, double, or triple bonds based on proximity.
4. **Dynamic Constraints**: Particles are constrained within the RBC, bouncing back when reaching the boundary.
